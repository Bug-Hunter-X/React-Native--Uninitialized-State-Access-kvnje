This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when using the useState hook or class components' states.  Here's an example of the problem in a functional component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In this example, `console.log(count)` inside useEffect might log `undefined` if it runs before useState assigns a value to `count`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

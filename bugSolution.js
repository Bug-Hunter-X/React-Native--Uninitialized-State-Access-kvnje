The solution involves ensuring that the state variable is accessed only after it has been initialized.  Here's a corrected version using the `useEffect` hook:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count); // Access after initialization
  }, [count]); // Add count as a dependency

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

```

This improved version ensures `count` is only accessed after being updated by the `useState` hook. Adding `count` as a dependency to the `useEffect` hook ensures the effect runs only after the `useState` initialization completes. If using class components, check the values in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method or later, ensuring the state is populated before accessing it.
